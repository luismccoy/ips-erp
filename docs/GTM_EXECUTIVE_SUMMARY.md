# IPS-ERP Go-To-Market Executive Summary
## Colombian Home Healthcare SaaS

**Prepared:** January 2026 | **Status:** Ready for Execution | **Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Market Opportunity

Colombia's home healthcare (atención domiciliaria) sector represents a **$32B+ market** with over 55,000 healthcare professionals, organized primarily through ACISD (40+ member IPS nationwide). The sector faces a perfect storm: EPS payment crisis ($32 trillion in debt), glosa rates reaching 62-99% on billing lines, and legacy technology that can't keep up with Resolución 2275 (RIPS) and Resolución 3100 (habilitación) compliance requirements. In 2024 alone, 1,831 IPS locations closed and 380 IPS shut down entirely. **IPS-ERP enters as the only solution with AI-powered glosa defense and a family portal—addressing existential pain points no competitor touches.**
