# IPS-ERP Production Homepage - Design Review

**Reviewer:** Senior UX/UI Designer (Healthcare Enterprise Specialist)  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Overall Rating:** 6.8/10  

---

## Executive Summary

This homepage is a **solid foundation** but currently sits in "good startup" territory rather than "enterprise healthcare leader." It has strong bones—good color psychology, decent typography, clear value props—but lacks the gravitas, social proof depth, and visual sophistication that Axxess, WellSky, and AlayaCare bring to market.

**The Good:** Clear pain-point messaging, strong AI differentiation, Colombian market focus
**The Bad:** Generic stock photography, weak social proof, missing enterprise trust signals
**The Ugly:** Testimonials feel fabricated, no real logos, stats lack credibility anchors

---

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Hero Section
**Rating: 7/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Headline is strong:** "Software que protege su facturación" immediately hits the pain point (money)
- **Gradient text treatment** adds visual interest without being gimmicky
- **Stats bar** at bottom provides immediate credibility
- **Dual CTAs** (demo + video) offer choice without overwhelming
- **Floating badges** add movement and break static feel

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Stock photo is TOO GENERIC.** The Unsplash image (photo-1576765608535-5f04d1e3f289) shows a generic healthcare scene. It's not Colombian, not home-healthcare specific, and I've seen it on 50+ healthcare sites
- **Stats lack credibility anchors.** "500+ IPS" sounds made up. Who verified this? When?
- **"$5.1M Recuperados mensualmente"** — COP or USD? Monthly across ALL clients or average? This vagueness undermines trust
- **Announcement badge** ("Roster Architect AI") is a feature, not news. Real news = "Named Top 10 HealthTech by X"
- **No trust logos visible** in hero—major enterprise miss

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Commission custom photography** of actual Colombian home healthcare settings. Budget ~$2,000 for a half-day shoot with real nurses, real homes, diverse patients
2. **Add credibility anchor to stats:** "500+ IPS Activas (audited Q4 2025)"
3. **Clarify currency:** "$5.1M COP" or use billions for clarity
4. **Add a single trust logo** above the headline: "Trusted by [Major IPS Name]"
5. **Replace announcement with real news:** Partnership, award, or certification

---

### 2. Trust Logos / Certifications Section
**Rating: 5/10**

#### What Works ✅
- Shows regulatory awareness (RIPS, Supersalud, ISO 27001)
- Clean, minimal presentation
- Hover effects add interactivity

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **WHERE ARE THE CLIENT LOGOS?!** This is the single biggest credibility miss. AlayaCare and WellSky show 20+ recognizable client logos
- **ISO 27001 claim needs verification.** If you're certified, show the badge. If not, remove it
- **"500+ IPS confían"** repeated without naming ONE. This screams "we're hiding something"
- **No third-party validation:** G2 rating? Capterra reviews? Industry awards?
- **Icons are generic.** Custom icons or actual certification marks would be stronger

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Get 6-10 real client logos** with permission. Even if IPS are small, their logos add credibility
2. **Add third-party trust signals:** "4.8★ on G2" | "Capterra Top 20" | "Colombia Digital Award 2025"
3. **Show certification marks properly:** ISO badge, not just an icon
4. **Add numbers with context:** "Trusted by 12,847 healthcare professionals" (cumulative users)

---

### 3. Challenges Section (Pain Points)
**Rating: 8/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Pain-first messaging** is strategically correct—agitate before solving
- **Specific numbers** (30% rejection, 8+ hours) feel researched
- **Color coding** of severity is intuitive (red=worst, purple=regulatory)
- **Question format** in headlines creates engagement
- **Cards are scannable** with clear hierarchy

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Stats need sourcing.** "30% de facturas rechazadas promedio"—says who? Add: "según ACHC 2024"
- **No emotional imagery.** Pure text cards feel clinical (ironic for healthcare)
- **"$$$" for regulatory fines** is lazy. Use real numbers: "$50M+ en multas anuales"
- **Missing urgency.** These feel like facts, not urgent problems to solve

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Source your statistics:** Add footnotes or inline citations
2. **Add subtle imagery:** Small icons or illustrations within cards
3. **Quantify ALL pain:** Turn "$$" into real numbers
4. **Add urgency trigger:** "Every month you wait costs ~$X in glosas"

---

### 4. AI Section (3 Agents)
**Rating: 7.5/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **3 distinct AI agents** is a strong differentiator—memorable and marketable
- **Tab interaction** is intuitive and engaging
- **Specific capabilities** listed (not vague "AI-powered")
- **"Powered by AWS Bedrock"** adds enterprise infrastructure credibility
- **Individual stats per agent** are compelling

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Images are wrong for the content.** Showing a woman at a desk for "Glosa Defender"? Should show the AI UI, not stock people
- **Names feel forced.** "Glosa Defender," "Roster Architect," "RIPS Validator"—very marketing-y. Competitors use simpler names
- **No animated demos or GIFs.** In 2026, static images for AI features feel dated
- **Missing the "how it works" clarity.** Users wonder: is this magic or do I have to do something?

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Replace stock images with UI screenshots or Lottie animations** showing the AI in action
2. **Consider simpler naming:** "Smart Claim Defense" vs "Glosa Defender AI"
3. **Add micro-interactions:** When hovering on capabilities, show brief animations
4. **Clarify human-in-loop:** "AI suggests, you approve in 1 click"
5. **Add ROI calculator:** "Enter your monthly glosas → see potential recovery"

---

### 5. Platform/Roles Section
**Rating: 6.5/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Three personas** (Admin, Nurse, Family) is the right segmentation
- **Feature cards** within each role are scannable
- **Emoji icons** add visual relief and scannability
- **Role-specific CTAs** ("Ver Demo para Administrador")

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Stock photos AGAIN.** The nurse image is generic. The admin image is a person at a desk—boring
- **"Family" persona feels underdeveloped.** Only 4 generic features
- **No actual UI shown.** I want to see the dashboard, not a stock photo of someone "using" software
- **Features are listed, not demonstrated.** "Dashboard Ejecutivo"—show it!
- **Color coding by role** is subtle to the point of invisibility

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Show real UI:** Admin dashboard screenshot, nurse app screenshot, family portal screenshot
2. **Reduce to 2 personas if Family is underdeveloped.** Better to do 2 well than 3 weakly
3. **Add video walkthroughs:** 30-second clips per role
4. **Stronger color differentiation:** Each role should have unmistakable visual identity

---

### 6. Mobile App Section
**Rating: 7.5/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Phone mockup** is more effective than stock photos—finally showing the product!
- **Offline-first messaging** is smart for Colombian field reality
- **Feature grid** is comprehensive and scannable
- **App Store badges** add legitimacy
- **Dark gradient background** creates visual contrast

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Mockup content is static.** Interactive or animated phone would be far more engaging
- **Only ONE screen shown.** Should carousel through 3-4 key screens
- **App Store badges but no reviews mentioned.** "4.9★ (2,000+ reviews)" would add credibility
- **Features sound similar to competitors.** Nothing uniquely Colombian or differentiated
- **No download stats.** "Downloaded by 3,400+ nurses" would be powerful

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Animate the phone mockup** with auto-playing screen transitions
2. **Add social proof:** "Used daily by 3,400+ healthcare professionals"
3. **Show app store ratings** if they're good (4.5+)
4. **Highlight Colombian-specific features:** "Works in Zona 4 with low connectivity"

---

### 7. Compliance Section
**Rating: 8/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Regulatory specificity** is excellent (Res. 3374, 3100, CIE-10/CUPS)
- **Stats bar** with compliance metrics is compelling
- **"Auditorías sin estrés"** is a great hook
- **Feature tags** within cards add detail without overwhelming
- **Green color psychology** = safety, compliance, trust

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **No proof of compliance claims.** "98% tasa de aceptación RIPS"—according to whom?
- **Missing compliance certifications.** If you have SOC 2, show it. If not, get it
- **No "last updated" for regulations.** Colombian regulations change; show you're current
- **CTA is buried.** "Ver Compliance en Acción" should be more prominent

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Add verification:** "98% RIPS acceptance rate (audited 2025)"
2. **Show compliance timeline:** "Updated for 2026 regulatory changes"
3. **Add security certifications:** SOC 2, HIPAA-equivalent, data residency
4. **Larger, more prominent CTA**

---

### 8. Stories/Testimonials Section
**Rating: 4/10** ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

#### What Works ✅
- **Format is good:** Quote + author + stats
- **Geographic diversity:** Medellín, Bogotá, Cali, Barranquilla
- **Specific numbers** in testimonials ("$180M," "60%")
- **Navigation between stories** is intuitive

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **TESTIMONIALS FEEL FABRICATED.** Generic names + Unsplash photos = zero credibility
- **No company verification.** "IPS Salud Integral"—is this real? Can I verify?
- **Photos are clearly stock.** The "Dra. Ana María Restrepo" is a generic stock photo I've seen elsewhere
- **Too perfect.** Every testimonial has amazing results. Where's the "it was hard but worth it" story?
- **Logo placeholders** at bottom literally say "Logo 1, Logo 2"—this is embarrassing

#### Specific Improvements (URGENT)
1. **Get 4-6 REAL testimonials** with real names, real photos, real companies
2. **Video testimonials** are 10x more credible than text
3. **Add LinkedIn verification:** Show LinkedIn profiles or "Verified customer" badges
4. **Include the struggle:** "Implementation took 3 weeks, but the ROI came in month 2"
5. **REMOVE the placeholder logos.** Better to have nothing than fake placeholders

---

### 9. Final CTA Section
**Rating: 7/10**

#### What Works ✅
- **Form is clean** and not overwhelming (5 fields)
- **"Tamaño de Operación" dropdown** helps qualify leads
- **24-hour response promise** sets expectations
- **Multiple contact options** (phone, email, WhatsApp)
- **Privacy policy link** adds trust

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **No urgency.** Why should I fill this out TODAY vs. next month?
- **Form has no incentive.** "Get a free industry report" or "Receive our ROI calculator" would increase conversions
- **Repeat of earlier CTA section.** If this is the "final" CTA, the earlier one in preview.html is redundant
- **No social proof near form.** "Join 47 IPS who requested demos this month"
- **Phone number in contact is clearly fake.** +57 300 123 4567 is placeholder-ish

#### Specific Improvements
1. **Add urgency:** "Book this month and get free implementation support"
2. **Add incentive:** "Download our 2026 Colombian Home Healthcare Tech Report"
3. **Add micro social proof:** "127 demos scheduled this quarter"
4. **Use real contact information**

---

### 10. Footer
**Rating: 6/10**

#### What Works ✅
- Clean, minimal design
- Legal links present
- Year is correct (2026)

#### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **No social media links.** LinkedIn especially important for B2B healthcare
- **No blog/resources link.** Content marketing is huge for enterprise trust
- **No office address.** Enterprise buyers want to know you're real
- **No security badges.** SSL, privacy shields, etc.
- **No language toggle.** English version for international branches?

#### Specific Improvements
1. Add LinkedIn, Twitter/X links
2. Add physical address in Colombia
3. Add "Resources" or "Blog" section
4. Add security trust badges (SSL, privacy)

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### Photography Strategy: 3/10 (CRITICAL)
The homepage relies entirely on generic Unsplash stock photos. This is the #1 thing killing enterprise credibility.

**Recommendations:**
1. Budget $3,000-5,000 for custom photography
2. Shoot in real Colombian homes with diverse families
3. Capture real nurses using tablets (your actual app on screen)
4. Get 30-50 photos to use across all marketing
5. Consider illustrated/vector style as alternative (like Notion, Linear)

### Color Psychology: 8/10 (GOOD)
Blue + Teal is appropriate for healthcare trust + innovation. Green for compliance sections is smart.

**Minor Improvements:**
- Reduce gradient usage slightly—can feel "startup-y"
- Add more white space in dense sections

### Typography: 7/10 (GOOD)
Inter is a solid, professional choice. Type scale is well-defined in design system.

**Improvements:**
- Consider a serif for headlines to feel more "established" (like healthcare incumbents)
- Increase body line-height from 1.6 to 1.7 for better readability

### Mobile Responsiveness: Not Fully Evaluated
Preview.html is desktop-focused. Need to verify mobile experience separately.

| Trust Logos | 5/10 | **HIGH** |
| Challenges | 8/10 | Low |

**Overall: 6.8/10**

This homepage can compete with regional players but not yet with Axxess, WellSky, or AlayaCare. The two critical fixes are:
1. **Real social proof** (testimonials, logos, reviews)
2. **Custom photography**

Fix these, and you'll jump to 8/10. Add video content and case studies, you'll hit 9/10.
