## Color Psychology for Enterprise Healthcare

### What Works (Research-Backed):

**Primary: Deep Blue (#1e40af, #1e3a8a)**
- Trust, professionalism, stability
- Used by: Axxess, WellSky, most healthcare enterprise
- Psychology: Calming, reduces anxiety, conveys expertise

**Secondary: Teal/Cyan (#14b8a6, #0891b2)**
- Modern healthcare, innovation
- Bridge between blue (trust) and green (health)
- Less common = differentiation

**Accent: Warm Orange (#f97316, #ea580c)**
- Action, energy, urgency (for CTAs)
- Contrast with blue creates attention
- Used sparingly for conversions

**Supporting: Slate/Gray (#475569, #334155)**
- Sophistication, neutrality
- Professional backgrounds
- Text hierarchy

### What to AVOID:
- Bright purple (too consumer, not enterprise)
- Neon colors (unprofessional)
- Pure black backgrounds (harsh, intimidating)
- Pastel everything (looks weak)
